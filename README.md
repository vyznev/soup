The [Stack Overflow Unofficial Patch (SOUP)][SA] is a project to collect various minor client-side bug fixes, work-arounds and usability improvements for [Stack Overflow][SO] and other Q&A sites on the [Stack Exchange Network][SE] into a single user script.

The intent of SOUP is not to make any substantial or controversial changes to the Stack Exchange user interface, but to fix minor problems and omissions that the SE developers have overlooked or haven't got around to fixing yet.  By combining these minor patches into a single user script, they become easier to install and maintain.


Installing
----------

SOUP can be installed either as a stand-alone browser extension or via a user script manager such as [Greasemonkey][GM], [Tampermonkey][TM] or [Violentmonkey][VM].

SOUP has been mainly developed and tested on Firefox and Chrome.  It may also run on other browsers with user script support (via Tampermonkey or other compatible extensions), but has not been fully tested on them.  Any reports of cross-browser issues are welcome.


### Installing as a browser extension

Users of Chrome or Firefox (including Firefox Mobile) can install SOUP as a browser extension:

* [**SOUP on Firefox Add-ons**][firefox-ext]
* [**SOUP on Chrome Web Store**][chrome-ext]

Note that updates to the extension packages available at Firefox Add-ons and Chrome Web Store may take a few days to appear, even after a new stable user script version is released, due to review and other delays.


### Installing as a user script

To install SOUP as a user script, you first need to install a  user script manager such as [Greasemonkey][GM] (for Firefox), [Tampermonkey][TM] or [Violentmonkey][VM].  (Other Greasemonkey compatible user script managers should also work.)  After installing the extension, clicking the ["download / install"][DL] button below should bring up a dialog asking you if you want to install SOUP.  Answer "yes".

> <sup>[View source][source] / [List of fixes][fixes] / [Change log][changes] / [GitHub repo][github]</sup>

> <sup>NOTE: SOUP is compatible with Firefox 57 / Greasemonkey 4.  However, due to a [known bug](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/2631 "bug #2631: GM 4.0 does not install scripts from GitHub (CSP/sandbox issue)"), installing SOUP (or any other user scripts) from GitHub may fail.  Until the bug is fixed (and until GM4 stabilizes more generally) I recommend using another user script manager (such as [Tampermonkey][TM] or [Violentmonkey][VM]) or the stand-alone [SOUP extension for Firefox][firefox-ext] instead.</sup>

> <sup>NOTE 2: Tampermonkey on Chrome suffers from [a race condition](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/211) that can cause some fixes that rely on early loading to fail to apply properly.  To avoid this, you should either use the stand-alone [SOUP Chrome extension][chrome-ext] or set Inject Mode to "Instant" in Tampermonkey preferences (in the Experimental section, only visible when Config Mode is set to "Advanced" above).  Other user script managers on Chrome may also be subject to similar issues.</sup>


### Installing the development version

If you like living on the edge, you can also install the development version of SOUP, which gets all the latest fixes and updates as soon as they're written.  Of course, it also gets all the latest bugs, too.  If you do install the development version, please report any bugs or regressions you may find in it below!

> ### [<kbd>Download / Install SOUP (development branch)</kbd>][devDL]  
> <sup>[View source][devsrc] / [List of fixes][devfixes] / [Change log][devchanges] / [GitHub repo][devel]</sup>

Note that the development version of SOUP is currently only available as a user script.
