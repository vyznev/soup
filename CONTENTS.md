SOUP v1.56
&#x20;
(development) includes fixes or workarounds for the following issues.

The fixes highlighted in **boldface** include particularly major interface improvements or fix particularly severe or widespread issues.  The choice of which fixes to highlight is unavoidably somewhat subjective, but in my personal opinion, these are the fixes you should actually install SOUP for &mdash; the rest are just icing on the cake.

### CSS-only fixes

These are pure CSS fixes.  They will be applied even if JavaScript is disabled on the site.  Most of these are fairly minor, but sometimes pervasive, issues.

### Site-specific fixes

These non-CSS fixes are applied only on specific SE sites.  There's a lot fewer of these, since the SE JavaScript framework is shared between all sites, whereas CSS is different for each site.  Thus, these fixes generally involve either rare site-specific customizations, or simply design fixes that cannot be implemented in pure CSS.

* **[boardgames1652: Switch Magic autocard over to a different search engine, Scryfall](https://boardgames.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1652)**

### Review fixes

These fixes apply to the post review interface.  I've listed them separately here, since they include some of the more notable interface tweaks in SOUP.

* **[mse172931: Please put answers underneath questions in Close review queue](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/172931)**
